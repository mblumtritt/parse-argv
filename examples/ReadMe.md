# Examples

This directory contains some examples for using ParseArgv. Play around and get an impression how an application will handle the command line by using ParseArgv.

To run an example just start with:

```shell
ruby examples/simple.rb --help
```

## check.rb

Can be used to test your help text syntax. Try the following to see it in action:

```shell
ruby examples/check.rb examples/multi.rb
```

## conversion.rb

This example demonstrates the conversion capabilities.

## multi.rb

This is an example of a "git-like" command - a command with subcommands.

## simple.rb

A simple and very basic demonstration.
